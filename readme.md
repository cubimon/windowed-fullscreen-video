# Windowed fullscreen video

This plugin makes html 5 videos full size in a window. This is especially useful if you have only one large screen and want to seperate space. This plugin was tested only on firefox, but should also work on chromium based browsers.

## Usage

To use, click the icon in the extension bar, next to the address bar or press `Ctrl+Shift+F`. The shortcut can be edited in Firefox 66. If no video was found, a message is shown.
To undo windowed fullscreen, simply click again on the icon.
For youtube and probably other sites, you should start the video first, then press the extension icon to "remember" correct css.
If you press the extension icon before playing the video, it will break if you undo windowed fullscreen mode.
This could be probably fixed by saving mutations in windowed fullscreen mode.

expand icon is from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/license) and tinted with gimp.
